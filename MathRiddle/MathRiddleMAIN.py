#a game that you must find the missing numbers in a 6x3 matrix by discovering the hidden pattern behind          #
#the numbers in the matrix that are known. The pattern is partially randomly generated, mining that will follow  #
#a set of predetermined rules but will also have random generated elements. Of corse the set of predetermined    #
#rules is enough to make the riddle always have a solution.                                                      #
