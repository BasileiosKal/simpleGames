 This game is a math riddle that requires from the user to find the missing numbers. The
way it works is the following: The program will create a 6x3 matrix with numbers that follow 
a certain pattern. Next will display it with the 3 numbers of the last row missing. The user 
must find the missing numbers by discovering the hidden pattern behind the rest of the 
matrix. The next picture is an example of how the riddle will look like.
  
  The program is designed to have a simple graphical user interface. In this interface besides
the actual riddle the user has the option to see 3 different clues or the solution to the riddle. 
He also can choose to exit the game or play again (if he finds the correct answer). Lastly, the 
GUI contains an entry for the answer and an enter button. 

  For future work, i indent to and different levels of difficulty to the game. That can be 
archived by ether changing slightly the way the pattern is constructed to make it more 
difficult to spot or to make the actual matrix bigger than 6x3.

 **IMPORTANT NOTE**: there’s more than one correct answers to the riddle. That’s because to 
make the answer singular, the program will need one extra rule that will use to construct 
the matrix, something that will make the pattern harder to figure out. The riddle will have a 
singular answer to the higher levels though.
